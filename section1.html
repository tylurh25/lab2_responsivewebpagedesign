        <h2> Business of Football/Soccer</h2>
        <p> Soccer or football depending on what region you are in, is noted as the most popular 
            sport worldwide with over active *3.5 billion* fans/players in over 200 countries. 
            The sport is goverened by FIFA internationally which is the main organization. 
            FIFA(Fédération Internationale de Football Association) was formed in 1904 to oversee 
            and organize international football competitions. FIFA is a non-profit so it invests most 
            of the money made back into the development of the sport which is probably one of the reasons 
            the sport has been so successful. Between 2019-2022 FIFA is estimated to have generated $7.6 billion 
            in revenue through marketing, television and licensing rights for major events like the World Cup.</p>
