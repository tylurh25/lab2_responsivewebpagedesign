        <h2> Rules of Football/Soccer</h2>
        <p>One of the main rules of soccer/football is the limited use of hands. Unless you are the goalie 
        or doing a throw-in, you use your hands on the ball. A throw-in is taken when the ball crosses 
        a sideline and leaves the field. The two basic soccer rules for a proper throw-in are to have 
        both feet on the ground and to throw the ball with both hands over the head. There are also 
        fouls in this game. A player cannot kick, trip, jump at, charge, strike, push, hold, or spit at an opponent. 
        The winner of the game is determined by the team with the most amount of goals scored.
